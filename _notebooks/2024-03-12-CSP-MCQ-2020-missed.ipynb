    "Question 20: A local router is configured to limit the bandwidth of guest users connecting to the Internet. Which of the following best explains the result of this configuration as compared to a configuration in which the router does not limit the bandwidth?\n",
    "- Incorrect Answer: The amount of time it takes guest users to send and receive large files is likely to decrease.\n",
    "- Why Incorrect?: Limiting the bandwidth of a connection is likely to increase the amount of time it takes to send and receive files.\n",
    "- Correct Answer: Guest users will be restricted in the maximum amount of data that they can send and receive per second.\n",
    "- Explanation: The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. With limited bandwidth, guest users will be restricted in the amount of data transmitted per second.\n",

    "Question 44: A program developed for a Web store represents customer account balances using a format that approximates real numbers. While testing the program, a software developer discovers that some values appear to be mathematically imprecise. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the imprecision?\n",
    "- Incorrect Answer: The account balances are represented using a fixed number of bits, resulting in overflow errors.\n",
    "- Why Incorrect?: An overflow occurs when a value exceeds the maximum representable value. This type of error does not typically lead to imprecision of values.\n",
    "- Correct Answer: The account balances are represented using a fixed number of bits, resulting in round-off errors.\n",
    "- Explanation: The fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers limits the range of these values; this limitation can result in round-off errors. Round-off errors typically result in imprecise values or results.\n",

    "- Incorrect Answer: An unauthorized individual poses as a network administrator and attempts to trick a user into providing personal information.\n",
    "- Why Incorrect?: Tricking a user into providing personal information is an example of a phishing attack. While this type of attack can be used to obtain personal information, it does not allow unauthorized individuals to intercept information transmitted on a network.\n",
    "- Correct Answer: An unauthorized individual gains the ability to view network traffic by connecting to a network router that uses weak or no security measures.\n",
    "- Explanation: A rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks. Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point.\n",
