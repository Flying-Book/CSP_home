    "## Our Project Feedback (Demo)\n",
    "### Glows: \n",

    "- Piecharts (healthy meal tracker)\n",
    "- Stress Progress Bar (Stress)\n",
    "- Graphs (Sleep and Exercise)\n",

    "### What I will change:\n",
    "- I will have the piechart for the USDA on full display because the piechart is constant (only the user one changes so it should be there when link is opened).\n",
    "- I will have more instructions on webpage on how ot use features to explain to the user.\n",
    "- I will also try to find an alterntaive to iframes because they can be hard to use and manade.\n",

    "![Alt Text]({{site.baseurl}}/images/IMG_3392.jpg)\n",
    "### Health Tracker\n",
    "It was nice to see a similar project and the variety within our features. I liked that they had more external APIs than us. They had many of the same features which was expected as we had a similar topic.\n",
